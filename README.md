# JavaScript Racer OOP Refactor

### Introduction

In this lab, we will be working again on our JavaScript Racer game from last week. You are going to create a new branch `OOP` so you won't break your game or lose your original code.

## Exercise

To make your code Object Oriented, think about the nouns of your project. These could be the objects you will create. 
At minimum, you are going to want to create a `Game` object, to which you can attach attributes like "inProgress" or "hasWinner" (whatever variables you had before), and functions like "checkForWinner" etc. 

#### Requirements

- A working game that uses Object Oriented Programming principles

**Bonus:**
- Add that feature you didn't have time to do over the weekend!

#### Starter code

Your starter code is your JS Racer game from last weekend. 

#### Deliverable

Your game should look the same as it did before, or better if you have time and want to update the UI :)

### Additional Resources

- Eloquent JavaScript's [chapter on Object Oriented Programming](http://eloquentjavascript.net/1st_edition/chapter8.html) gets a little advanced, but is excellent.

### Self Evaluation

During the previous exercise, rate your progress on a scale of 1-5 (5 being the highest) for the following criteria:

- **Persistence:** Do you handle frustration well? Do you independently pursue understanding?
- **Organization:** Do you thoughtfully implement best coding patterns and practices?
- **Collaboration:** Do you make an effort solve problems and share your ideas with others?
- **Communication:** Do you clearly convey your thoughts to others in illustrative and clear ways?
- **Self-compassion:** Do you make productive use of turning failures into learning opportunities?
- **Resourcefulness:** Do make an effort to compare and contrast new ideas with ones you already know?
